  "bio": "Hello, I'm Anna, a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for details, I strive to create responsive websites that deliver seamless functionality. My interest in being a web developer sparked when I was on a vocational course for IT Technician. I completed a few courses on Udemy platform and took a 9-month Web Developer Bootcamp by Kodilla. As a problem solver, I enjoy translating design concepts into interactive and user-friendly web pages. I continuously seek to expand my skills and I enjoy learning new things. I'm excited to embark on new projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals and teams to create exceptional web experiences. If you have a project or opportunity you'd like to discuss, please feel free to get in touch.\n\nHere are a few technologies and tools I've been working with recently:",
